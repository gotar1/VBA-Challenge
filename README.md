* Build VBA script to analyze real stock market data [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx).
* Make appropriate adjustments so the VBA script will allow run on every worksheet once we run the script.

  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.
* Included conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
